# Brock University COSC 4P02 Chatbot Application
#### Introduction
Brock University is home to thousands of students and academics from all over the world, with more and more students and resources being added year after year. Through the rise of the Covid-19 pandemic, it is imperative that students and faculty members can access information in an extremely quick and controlled fashion. 

Ideally, the goal of our group and in turn this project is to create a chat-bot that will be able to provide users, such as Students, Faculty, and Canada Summer Games visitors, with accurate information in an extremely quick and efficient way, in regards to various aspects of Brock University along with the 2022 Canada Summer Games.
